# Markov-Model
This project creates a Markov Model of the recorded PM2.5 Index based
on data from the Changping data set. The PM2.5 readings are broken into four ranges: low(0-50),
moderate(51-100), high(101-150), and very high(151+). Then the transition probabilities were calculated
for each of those four ranges and used to create a Markov Model.
